    ‚ú® A repository containing all the tech books / tutorials / blogs I have read. Reading makes me happy.
  </p>

To-Learn-By-Books is a repository recording the books I have read and my learning notes. 
The content varies from Math, CS to Economics. Every book has its own directory and 
a `README.md` index, which records the contents of the corresponding book or tutorial.
