// Rust groups errors into two major categories: *recoverable* and *unrecoverable* errors
// For a recoverable error, such as a *file not found* error, we most likely just want
// to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable errors are
// always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a location beyond the end of an array,
// and so we want to immediately stop the program.

// Rust has 'Result<T, E>' for recoverable errors and the 'panic!' macro that stops execution
// when the program encounters an unrecoverable error.

// Panics will print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack and quit
