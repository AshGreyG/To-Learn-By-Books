    // Every value in Rust is of a certain **data type**, which tells Rust what
    // kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.
    // Rust is a **statically typed** language, which means that it must know
    // the types of all variables

    // A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary types:
    // integers, floating-point numbers, booleans and characters.

    // Integer type has the difference between *signed* (using i) and *unsigned*
    // (using u). The integer types in Rust:

    //    Length       Signed       Unsigned
    //     8-bit        i8              u8
    //    16-bit        i16             u16
    //    32-bit        i32             u32
    //    64-bit        i64             u64
    //   128-bit        i128            u128
    //      arch        isize           usize
    
    // The 'isize' and 'usize' types depend on the architecture of the computer
    // program is running on: 64 bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture and
    // 32-bits if you're on a 32-bit architecture.

    let num_decimal = 98_222;   // decimal
    let num_hex = 0xff;         // hex
    let num_octal = 0o77;       // octal
    let num_binary = 0b1011_1;  // binary
    let num_byte = b'A';        // byte
    println!("{num_decimal}, {num_hex}, {num_octal}, {num_binary}, {num_byte}");

    // Rust's defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default
    // to 'i32', the primary situation in which you'd use 'isize' or 'usize'
    // is when indexing some sort of collection.

    // 'u8' can hold values between 0 and 255, if you try to change the variable
    // to a value outside that range, such as 256, *integer overflow* will occur.
    // Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to
    // *panic* at runtime if this behavior occurs. When you're compiling in
    // release mode with the '--release' flag, Rust does not include checks for
    // integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust
    // performs *two's complement wrapping*. In the case of a 'u8', the value
    // 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1. The program won't panic, but the
    // variable will have a wrong value.

    // Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, they are
    // 'f32' and 'f64', which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size. The default type
    // is 'f64' because on modern CPUs, it's roughly the same speed as 'f32' but
    // is capable of more precision.

    let num_float_default = 2.0;    // f64
    let num_float_32: f32 = 3.0;    // f32
    println!("{num_float_default} {num_float_32}");

    let _t = true;
    let _f: bool = false;

    let _char_z = 'z';    // c: char
    let _char_z_explicit = 'Z';
    let _bingo_emoji = 'âœ…';

    // Compound types can group multiple values into one type, Rust has two primitive
    // compound types: tuples and arrays:

    let _test_tuple: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // The variable '_test_tuple' binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is 
    // considered a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a
    // tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value:

    let (_x, _y, _z) = _test_tuple;
    println!("The value of x, y, and z are {_x}, {_y}, {_z}");

    // This is called *destructuring* because it breaks the single tuple into three
    // parts. We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period '.'
    // followed by the index of the value we want to access:

    let index_x = _test_tuple.0;
    let index_y = _test_tuple.1;
    let index_z = _test_tuple.2;
    println!("The value of x, y and z using index are {index_x}, {index_y}, {index_z}");

    // The tuple without any values has a special name: *unit*. This value and its
    // corresponding type are both written '()' and represent an empty value or an
    // empty return type.
    
    // Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an *array*. Unlike
    // a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in
    // some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

    let _test_int_array = [1, 2, 3];    // [i32; 3]

    // An array isn't as flexible as the vector type. A *vector* is a similar collection
    // type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow and shrink in size.
    // Arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change

    ];
