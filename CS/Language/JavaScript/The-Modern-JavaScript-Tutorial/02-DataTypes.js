// There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. We can put any type
// in a variable. A variable can at one moment be a string and then
// store a number. Programming languages that allow such things such
// as JavaScript are called "dynamical typed", meaning that there exist
// data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

let testMessage = "hello";  // testMessage: string
testMessage = 12;           // testMessage: number now
