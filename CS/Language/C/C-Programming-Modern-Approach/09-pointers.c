// In most modern computers, main memory is divided into bytes, with each byte
// capable of storing *eight bits* of information.
//
// Each byte has a unique *address* to distinguish it from other bytes. If
// there are n bytes in memory, we can think of addresses as numbers that range
// from 0 to n - 1.
//
// The address of the first byte is said to be the address of the variable.
// Although addresses are represented by numbers, their range of values may
// differ from that of integers, so we can't necessarily store them in ordinary
// integer variables. We can store them in special *pointer variables*.
//
// C requires that every pointer variable point only to objects of a particular
// type (the referenced type).

// C passes arguments by value, if we want the function be able to modify the
// variable, we should use pointer parameters. Array parameters actually are
// pointer parameters. If we don't want to change the value of object that
// pointers point to, we can use `const` keyword

    // To find the address of a variable, we use the & address operator. If `x`
    // is a variable, then `&x` is the address of `x` in memory. To gain access
